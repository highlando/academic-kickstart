# Summary

The John Hopkins University (JHU) collects data on how the COVID-19 virus
spreads over the world and makes it [available on
github](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19). In this analysis, we take
the data and extract the numbers that describe how the growth of casualties
develops. Looking at the trends in these numbers, one may decide whether a
country is about taking control of the spread of the virus.

Feel free to use the [*python*
implementation](https://github.com/highlando/covid-over-any-time-soon) that
produces the presented plots and that can be modified to show the results for
any country that is in the JHU data base.

# Why This Analysis

If one looks at the actual numbers generated by an exponential growth, the
overall growth is so strong, that one barely sees changes in the dynamics. If
one looks at the numbers in log scale, the data becomes more handy. In log scale
an exponential growth looks like a straight line and the slope of the line
indicates how fast the exponential growth is.

To see whether the exponential growth changes its dynamics, one may check
whether the line in the logarithmic plot chages its slope (*hopefully it gets
less steep*). Thats why we plot the slope of the logarithmic line that connects
the numbers of two consecutive days. Since the data is wiggly, we also plot
averages of the slopes over 2 or 5 days to better spot the trends.

# The Analysis

We examine the (logarithmic) slope of the curves of the accumulated casualties
per day.  That is for day `d` and the day `d-1` before that day, we plot `log2(x[d]) -
log2(x[d-1])`, where `x` holds the number of accumulated deaths for every day
and where `log2` is a function that computes the logarithm of a number with
respect to the basis `2`.


## Illustrative Examples

To make sense of the numbers, we start with some example scenarios. In the plot
below, we have plotted the values for some *fictuous* growth scenarios.

 * an exponential growth -- every day `d` the number of additional casualties is
   `1.2**d` (*speak: `1.2` to the power of `d`*). Note that `1.2` is the rate that is
   assumed to be still manageable by the German health care system. This
   scenario leads to a constant value in the plots of around `0.263`.

 * a constant growth -- every day another `10` casualties are added. This is
   like the number of daily deaths due to traffic incidents in Germany[^1] in 2010.

 * a growth that decreases exponentially -- every day the number of additional
   casualties gets smaller exponentially.

## General Explanations of the Numbers

 * A **constant** value means that the number of deaths grows exponentially. 
   * If this constant is **1**, this means that the numbers of casualties
     **doubles** every day.
   * A value of about **0.5** means a daily plus of **40%**.
 * A **decreasing** curve indicates that the exponential growth of seriously
   infected people is stalled or reversed.
 * If the value approaches **0**, this indicates that the virus is contained.
 
# The Actual Numbers

As of today -- March 22, 2020 -- the JHU data delivers the following numbers.
See the [pdf file](slopes-dsifc.pdf) for a better resolution of the plots.

## Interpretation of the JHU Data

As of today, I would say that:

 * *China* is clearly on the way to having contained the spread.
 * *Italy* and *Spain* seem to have weakened the exponential growth.
 * *France* and *Germany* still in exponential growth.

I will update the plots and the interpetations on a daily basis.

## Other Things that can be Seen

 * The curves seem to have similar phases. A phase of exponential growth
   followed by a decrease. 
 * The curves differ in the length of the phases (France seems to have a long
   phase of exponential growth if compared to Spain) 
 * And the starting points are different which gives a hint on when the outbreak
   became visible in the different countries.
 
# Note

Certainly, the casualties lag[^2] behind the actual spreading of the virus by a number of days. However, one may think that numbers of casualties are a more reliable data point than the number of infected.
